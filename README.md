A collection of data analysis projects using Python, SQL, Excel, and other analytical tools.
Each project includes datasets, preprocessing steps, analysis workflows, and insights derived from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations.

This repository acts as a portfolio showcasing my data analysis skills across various tools and technologies.
